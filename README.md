# Airbnb NYC Dataset Analysis

This repository contains an analysis of Airbnb prices in New York City. We delve into various aspects of pricing across different neighborhood groups, examining average prices, service fees, and room types.

Included is a Tableau notebook offering visualizations, including a color-coded map representing neighborhood groups and their respective average prices, median minimum nights, construction year, and room types. Additionally, one graph offers interactive parameters to adjust bin size for clearer price visualization.

Another graph presents the average price and service fee per room type, sorted by neighborhood group.
