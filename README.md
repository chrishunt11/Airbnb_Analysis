## Analysis Highlights

### Patterns in Host Behaviors

The analysis reveals notable patterns in host behaviors based on location and the type of room listed on Airbnb:

- **Distribution by Location:** The majority of Airbnb listings are concentrated in Manhattan and Brooklyn, with fewer listings in Queens, the Bronx, and Staten Island. This suggests that hosts in Manhattan and Brooklyn may have different behaviors compared to hosts in other boroughs.

- **Room Type Distribution:** The most common types of rooms listed are Entire home/apartment and Private room, comprising the majority of listings across all locations. This indicates that hosts generally prefer to rent out entire homes/apartments or private rooms rather than shared rooms or hotel rooms.

- **Variation by Borough:** There are differences in the distribution of room types among boroughs. For example, in Brooklyn, there are relatively more Entire home/apartment listings compared to Private room listings, while in Manhattan, the opposite is true. This suggests that host behaviors may vary depending on the specific borough and its characteristics.

- **Less Common Room Types:** Shared rooms and hotel rooms make up a smaller percentage of listings across all locations. This implies that hosts may perceive less demand for shared rooms and hotel rooms compared to entire homes/apartments and private rooms.

These insights offer valuable information for both hosts and potential guests when navigating the Airbnb market in New York City.
